# Prompt Assembly

Gauss deliberately separates:

- **cached system prompt state**
- **ephemeral API-call-time additions**

This is one of the most important design choices in the project because it affects:

- token usage
- prompt caching effectiveness
- session continuity
- memory correctness

Primary files:

- `run_agent.py`
- `agent/prompt_builder.py`
- `tools/memory_tool.py`

## Cached system prompt layers

The cached system prompt is assembled in roughly this order:

1. default agent identity
2. tool-aware behavior guidance
3. optional system message
4. frozen MEMORY snapshot
5. frozen USER profile snapshot
6. skills index
7. context files (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)
8. timestamp / optional session ID
9. platform hint

## API-call-time-only layers

These are intentionally *not* persisted as part of the cached system prompt:

- `ephemeral_system_prompt`
- prefill messages
- gateway-derived session context overlays

This separation keeps the stable prefix stable for caching.

## Memory snapshots

Local memory and user profile data are injected as frozen snapshots at session start. Mid-session writes update disk state but do not mutate the already-built system prompt until a new session or forced rebuild occurs.

## Context files

`agent/prompt_builder.py` scans and sanitizes:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`

Long files are truncated before injection.

## Skills index

The skills system contributes a compact skills index to the prompt when skills tooling is available.

## Why prompt assembly is split this way

The architecture is intentionally optimized to:

- preserve provider-side prompt caching
- avoid mutating history unnecessarily
- keep memory semantics understandable
- let gateway/ACP/CLI add context without poisoning persistent prompt state
