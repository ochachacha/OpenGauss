## Compatibility Notes

- `/handoff` is no longer a public generic workflow. In compatibility mode it forwards to `/autoformalize`.
- Bundled skill slash commands are not part of the default Gauss surface.
- `/reload-mcp` is not part of the default Gauss surface. Managed Lean workflows use their own isolated Lean MCP config.
